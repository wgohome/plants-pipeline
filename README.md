[## A. First Setup](https://github.com/wirriamm/plants-pipeline/blob/master/docs/setup.md)

This segment only needs to be implemented at the first setup of this repository on your local machine/server.

[## B. Every initialization for each session](https://github.com/wirriamm/plants-pipeline/blob/master/docs/initialize.md)

These commands need to be run everytime the pipeline is accessed from a new terminal session. They will load the python environment with the installed packages, and add ascp and kallisto commands to the global environment $PATH. If kallisto or ascp(Aspera CLI) is not downloaded, they will also be downloaded.

[## C. Bulk Run](https://github.com/wirriamm/plants-pipeline/blob/master/docs/download.md)
